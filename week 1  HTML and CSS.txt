                <h5 class="article_title"> How to become a talented artist? </h5>
                <p class="paragraph"> When people see a talented artist drawing often remark that they wish they could draw better. The simplest step many people haven’t realise is to "Draw". A lot of people who should don’t consider drawing to be all that important. They’re designers or photographers and don’t understand the technical and observational acumen that results from drawing and how it will enhance their design skill or photographic eye.

                Drawing slows you down. When you draw, you’re taking time to look at something, to analyse it and reproduce it. You’re not simply setting up to capture it and move on to the next image. You become very aware of form, proportion and colour. You come to understand light and shadow and how they reveal and define form. This awareness translates to any visual pursuit.

                For those who want to draw better, here are a few recommendations: <a href= "https://alvalyn.com/8-tips-for-improving-your-drawing-skills/"> read more </a>

                <h5 class="article_title"> Different forms of art </h5>
                <p class="paragraph">It is through art that we can communicate to the world our inner feelings and our creativity that only exists within our mind. Art has many forms; from visual arts to performing arts. Many great civilizations and cultures are perceived to be great because they were advanced in the arts. The strength and culture of an entire nation or civilization rests upon how rich the art of that particular country or civilization is. There are different forms of art like painting, sculpture, literature, architecture, music, dance, theater, photography and films.

                Whatever form of art we see, its main characteristic is that it is pleasing to the senses. It expresses the feelings and emotions of the artist and it can be interpreted in different ways by different people. Any type of art, essentially tells a story. It is a form of communication with another human being that is indirect but deeply profound. Art has a tendency to deeply move our souls and most masterpieces that we see in museums are a silent testimony to that. <a href= "https://arthearty.com/different-forms-of-art"> read more </a>
